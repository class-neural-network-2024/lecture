## Objective

- We will study mathematical foundations for neural networks and their applications

## Flipped Learning

- Students are expected to study using the online lectures
- Students are expected to implement deep learning algorithms in Python

## Contents

- Image Classification
- Image Denoising
- Image Segmentation
- Image Inpainting
- Image Generation
- Sequential Prediction

## Tools

- Class management
  - google classroom
  - [github](https://github.com), [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

- Programming
  - [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - python3 ([anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com))
  - jupyter notebook
  - [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
 
## Grading Policy

- assignments
- exams (if necessary)

### Assignments

- Submission should be made to GitHub and Google Classroom
- Late submissions result in the zero score
- Failure (no submission or zero score) of half or more assignments results in the fail of the class
- Discussions among students are not allowed
- Cheating will result in the immediate fail of the class
- Deadline is set to be 11:59 pm in GitHub and Google Classroom, but the actual deadline is always 11:30 pm instead

### Exams

- We will have exams if we decided that the assignments are not able to provide fair evaluations
